# âš¡ Optimal DC Power Flow - MATLAB Implementation

This project solves the **Optimal Power Flow (OPF)** problem using a **DC power flow model** and **linear programming**. The model is implemented in MATLAB and calculates optimal power dispatch, bus voltage angles, and line power flows, subject to system constraints like generator limits and line capacities.

## ğŸ§  Overview

The goal is to minimize the total generation cost while satisfying:

- Power balance at each bus
- Generator upper and lower bounds
- Line flow limits

The system is modeled using a DC approximation of power flow, making the optimization linear and solvable using `linprog`.
